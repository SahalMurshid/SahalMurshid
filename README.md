# 👋 Hey, I'm Sahal Murshid

🎓 I'm currently in my 3rd year of B.Tech in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** at Ilahia College of Engineering and Technology, Kerala.

🔍 I'm passionate about **solving real-world problems with smart technology** — combining AI, Machine Learning, and full-stack development to build meaningful projects. Whether it's using object detection to reduce human-wildlife conflict, or building real-time tracking systems for transportation, I enjoy every part of turning ideas into working solutions.

## 💡 What I'm Working On

- 🚧 **Smart Elephant Fencing System**  
  A real-world AI + IoT project using YOLO object detection, warning zones, deterrent sounds, lights, and shockwaves to reduce human-elephant conflict in Kerala.

- 🚌 **KSRTC Bus Tracking App (In Progress)**  
  Real-time bus location tracking app inspired by “Where’s My Train”, using FastAPI backend + Flutter frontend and PostgreSQL database.

- 🎥 **Video Analysis with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (In Development)**  
  System that takes video input, extracts frames, runs analysis, stores insights in a RAG database (ChromaDB), and answers questions about the video.

- 🤖 **Mini Machine Learning Projects** (Coming Soon)  
  Uploading small projects like fake news detection, movie recommendation system, and digit recognition to strengthen my portfolio.
